## Reil: Reactive Interface Language

Language meant to be an 80% solution. A 



loops are replaced with
streams: execution that happen over time
reducers: higher order functions that operate over multiple data points

each node compiles to a unique and independant vector. These nodes can then be executed independantly.

Ideally a programmer could use the language in manner similar to that of a terminal prompt. A secondary file will be used to project the current state of the program.
